# CIS496 Git Activity
This repo contains an activity on all the basic git operations to give you some hands on practice.

Please reference the Week1 folder on this repo for some basic introduction: https://github.com/fmillion-mnsu/cs480-f23/blob/master/week1/README.md
Further explanation and context will be provided in this README. 

# Objectives
- To gain an understanding and practice with the following git commands...
  - fetch
  - commit
  - push
  - pull
  - revert
  - reset
- To practice branching, making pull requests, and merging
- To learn some best practices
- To learn about merge conflicts and how to resolve them

# Pre-Requisites
- A GitHub Account: https://github.com/
- Visual Studio Code installed: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- GitHub Desktop installed: https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop
- Python installed (You can do this in VSCode under extensions if you don't already have it otherwise on Python's website)

# What is GitHub?
GitHub is a version control platform that allows developers to manage their code.

# Why should you care?
Without GitHub or any version control system it would be near impossible for people to collaborate on development projects in an effective manner. Code would have to be emailed back and forth whenever someone makes a change. If you have good experience with GitHub and can showcase that to your potential employers it will give you a good leg up.

# Part 1 - Branching & Commiting 
Now we will get into the sauce. 

**Step 0:** Fork this repository and name it `Activity1-firstname-lastname` but use your actual name.  

**Make sure you uncheck "Copy the `main` branch only".**  

You won't be able to proceed with the assignment if you don't.  

Learn more about Forks here: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo  

**Step 1:** Clone the repository using the nice little green code button and select "Open with GitHub Desktop"  
![image](https://github.com/Madeline-Ellingson/cis496-Activity/assets/93016306/664013d0-49d4-4ec7-adca-473f3960eb27)

You may get a popup saying to open GitHub desktop. Go ahead and click that and click clone. 

**Step 2:** Go ahead and switch into the `part1` branch and create a new branch off of it called..... `firstname_lastname_part1` but obviously replace `firstname` and `lastname` with your actual name. **This will count towards your grade!**
If you don't switch to the `part1` branch BEFORE creating your new branch it will have the wrong head branch and will not be counted. 

**Step 3:** Now that you have sucessfully created a branch go ahead and open up the branch in VSCode. You can easily do this by selecting the "Open in Visual Studio Code" option on GitHub Desktop or going to the Repository dropdown and open it from there.
You may not have VSCode as your default editor. If you don't see it as an option anywhere then go into the settings and switch it to your default editor. 

**Step 4:** Go ahead and create a new file `hello.py` and add a print statement to it that prints... "Hello my name is _________" but add your name instead. 

**Step 5:** If you saved the file you should now see it appear in GitHub Desktop. Go ahead and select that file and commit it. You will need to add a commit message in order to do so. 

**Best Practice:** It is good when working on any project to make smaller more reasonable commits. You don't want to commit a ton of files at once. Maybe 1 or 2 maximum unless they are tiny 1 line changes. This will also be a way to easily save your progress and make it more maneageble if you mess up and decide you need to revert a change.

It IS NOT good practice to commit directly into main. ALWAYS make a feature branch. Many many headaches are created from merging into main. Later on we will learn how to revert commits which will help in any instance that you do things you didn't intend. 

That is it for this part!

# Part 2 - Merging and Pull Requests
In this part we are going to practice merging and creating a nice neat and tidy pull request.

**Pull Request:** A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another  

**Step 1:** Switch to the `part2` branch and open er up in VSCode. 

**Step 2:** You should now see a lot more files in your repo. In order to be able to run this little pygame we first need to install all the required packages using the following command. 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you don't have a terminal open then you can select the View dropdown and select Terminal or use ``Ctrl + ` ``

**Pro Tip:** If you have a python project where you have installed a bunch of packages you can generate a requirements.txt file using the following command.

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

**Where I got this code:** https://github.com/dhhruv/Chrome-Dino-Runner

**Step 3:** Now we can run the Dino Game using the following command.

`python chromedino.py`

If you got your game to run then great! Make sure to push on github desktop otherwise your changes won't show up on the web. 

Now it is time to make a pull request.

**Step 4:** Go onto GitHub on the web to your fork and create a pull request. Under the pull requests tab you can make a new pull request. 

**Make sure to switch the base off of the main repository and onto your forked one**

The window should then look like this...

![image](https://github.com/Madeline-Ellingson/CIS496-GitActivity/assets/93016306/b3782dc7-48bf-41bc-84d8-9d92a71bb2df)

Go ahead and hit create.

From there hit create pull request. You will now see a window that looks like this below...

![image](https://github.com/Madeline-Ellingson/CIS496-GitActivity/assets/93016306/c024cf79-ed5a-430a-914f-9a1239c63180)

Wow! That is very blank. **This is not good practice.**  

You now have a blank PR!

When you make a pull request you want it to be descriptive as to what you are adding and the code changes made. In the next steps we will learn how to make a *pull request template* that will help to organize this information. 

**Step 5:** Delete this blank pull request by hitting the "Close pull request" button at the bottom of the screen. It won't remove it from the git history so you won't have a spotless repository but that is ok we are still learning!

**Step 6:** Hop back into vscode on the part 2 branch and create the following folder in the root directory `.github`. This is where we will store our template. GitHub knows to look in this folder. 

**Step 7:** Create a file `pull_request_template.md` and add the following text inside. 

```md
## Description
description of pull request

## Summary of issue/feature
Issue summary

## Code Changes
*
*
*

## PR Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Build completed/ Tests passed locally
- [ ] Issue linked in PR and commit messages (#issue)
```

There are other types of templates you can add to this folder such as if you are using GitHub issues which we won't get into in this activity but they are all written in a language called Markdown. You may already be familliar with it. 

This template features a few nice things that can help you keep track of code changes and give reviewers a better idea of what they are looking at and the changes purpose. 

A lot of this doesn't apply to what we are doing in this activity but is very nice to utilize in your personal projects and you will absolutely see something very similar if you ever go into industry as a software developer.

**Step 8:** Commit this file to your part2 branch and try to make a pull request again. You should now see your lovely template. Fill it out with what information you think is relevant or just throw a nice meme in there and create your PR. 

Isn't that a lot better?

**Step 9:** If GitHub gives you the green light to merge into main then go ahead and do so.

That is it for this part!

# Part 3 - Conflicts, Mistakes, Regrets

In this part we will cover merge conflicts and how to revert a commit. 

**Step 1:** Checkout the `part3` branch and try to run the dino game like we did in part 2. Has something changed?

**Step 2:** Make a pull request to merge the `part3` branch into `main`. Once its created you should now see a warning that there is merge conflicts! Oh no!

**Step 3:** Click on "Resolve Conflicts". You will then be brought to the conflicts editor. Below is an example of what a single line conflict looks like in the `.gitignore` file.

![image](https://github.com/Madeline-Ellingson/CIS496-GitActivity/assets/93016306/4dbb272b-8cca-4e69-9525-3ded611392ad)

On the top half above the ====== Will be the change from the branch specified. In this example its `part2`. On the bottom will be what the branch you are merging into has. In order to resolve these conflicts you will need to delete one version or the other and take out the separators. That means........

If you want to keep the code from `whatever branch` Remove the...   
```>>>>>>>>> whatever branch
=================

>>>>>>>>>>> whatever other branch
```
But keep the  
`*bat`

So the resulting window would look like this...  

![image](https://github.com/Madeline-Ellingson/CIS496-GitActivity/assets/93016306/f0d4b668-ccc9-4619-ae8b-6c4b89925323)

You can now see that nothing is highlighted which means the conflicts are resolved. 

Now that you have an idea go ahead and resolve the conflicts. In this case we want to...........

- Reject the screen width and height changes
- Remove the fullscreen parameter
- Reject the window height and ground height
- Keep the dinosaur red
- Keep the clouds blue
- Reject the changes to Obstical but make sure the rbg values still apply (This option will be a blend of both keeping stuff from `main` and keeping stuff from `part3`

This means when you end up running the game you shouldn't be able to play forever without jumping. The obsticals should stay on the ground. 

Once you are happy with the state of affairs and there are no more highlights then you can go ahead and resolve conflicts.

**Step 4:** Now we still have an issue. Our cactus's are all dead and yellow. We want them to be green! To fix this we are going to revert a commit. 

Look at the commit history on main. You can do this by clicking on commits. 

![image](https://github.com/Madeline-Ellingson/CIS496-GitActivity/assets/93016306/2e7c8065-c480-4308-aeb9-521b30e0a64a)

You should see this sus commit. 

![image](https://github.com/Madeline-Ellingson/CIS496-GitActivity/assets/93016306/674eb766-6f45-4934-b79b-061aba126297)

Go ahead and copy the id. 

**Step 5:** In order to revert this commit go into vscode and run the following command `git revert the_id_you_copied`. 

This may cause more merge conflicts that you have to resolve or entirely break everything. Who konws! 

Once you get this far let me know! But if all goes well you should be able to commit and push the revert. Re-run the game and your cactus should be green!
